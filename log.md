## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**: Finished going through introduction to Numpy.

**Thoughts**: Numpy arrays are very interesting. Not only do they provide an efficient way of manipulating Datasets but also make it easier and faster.
              No blockers so far and having learnt the basis of dataset manipulation I'm more than eager to move to Pandas.

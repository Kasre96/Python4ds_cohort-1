# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction to Ipython

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through Introduction to Ipython

**Thoughts**: Feeling great to learn Ipython. No blockers so far.

## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**: Finished going through introduction to Numpy.

**Thoughts**: Numpy arrays are very interesting. Not only do they provide an efficient way of manipulating Datasets but also make it easier and faster.
              No blockers so far and having learnt the basis of dataset manipulation I'm more than eager to move to Pandas.

## Week 3: Chapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas

**This week's Progress**: Finished up on Data Manipulation with Pandas.

**Thoughts**: Wow! It feels great to finally understand Pandas. Its a pretty wide subject but equally productive.
               Very ready to dig into the challenge and gauge my understanding.

## Week 4: Practice(Challenge 1)

**This week's Progress**: Completed the Data Manipulation Challenge 1.

**Thoughts**: My first Data Science challenge. Very glad to have acquired some quality skills and very ready to dig into visualizations.
